//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q1 HERE]
    
    The optional declaration after wordA & wordB is unnecessary since it was already addressed in the typing of words in init ([String]?)
    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q2 HERE]
    i is defined to be a unchangeable constant, so we can't say i++. Also, we should return true instead of nil
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool? {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character : Int]()
        let lenA = wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
}

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
    countLetters never gets initialized, so when we try to put inputs in, there's no dictionary to put them in

//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
